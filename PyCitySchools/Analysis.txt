Based upon the information and review of the data, I was able to formulate the following observations:

1. The Charter schools had a better overall passing rate than compared to the District schools and the gap was significant within the subject of math. 

2. Higher per student spending did not correlate to better scores as the lower spending ranges had better overall reading and math scores. 

3. Schools with a lower student count seemed to have better test scores thus we can assume this is due to a lower student to teacher ratio; however, this hypothesis cannot be deemed as correct as we do not have information regarding the classroom sizes. 

4. Based upon the data analysis, I would be personally inclined to send my child to a school within the small or medium size than the large size. 

5. Charter schools seemed to have better success with their students than compared to the district schools.
